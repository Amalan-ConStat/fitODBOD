\title{COM Poisson Binomial Distribution}
\usage{
dCOMPBin(x,n,p,v)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of binomial random variables.}

\item{n}{single value for no of binomial trials.}

\item{p}{single value for probability of success.}

\item{v}{single value for  v.}
}
\value{
The output of \code{dCOMPBin} gives a list format consisting

\code{pdf}           probability function values in vector form.

\code{mean}          mean of COM Poisson  Binomial Distribution.

\code{var}           variance of COM Poisson  Binomial Distribution.
}
\description{
These functions provide the ability for generating probability function values and
cumulative probability function values for the COM Poisson  Binomial Distribution.
}
\details{
The probability function and cumulative function can be constructed and are denoted below

The cumulative probability function is the summation of probability function values.

\deqn{P_{COMPBin}(x) = \frac{{n \choose x}^v p^x (1-p)^{n-x}}{\sum_{j=0}^{n} {n \choose j}^v p^j (1-p)^{(n-j)}}}
\deqn{x = 0,1,2,3,...n}
\deqn{n = 1,2,3,...}
\deqn{0 < p < 1}
\deqn{-\infty < v < +\infty }

\strong{NOTE} : If input parameters are not in given domain conditions
necessary error messages will be provided to go further.
