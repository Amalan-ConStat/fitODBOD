\title{Additive  Binomial Distribution}
\usage{
pAddBin(x,n,p,alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of binomial random variables.}

\item{n}{single value for no of binomial trials.}

\item{p}{single value for probability of success.}

\item{alpha}{single value for alpha parameter.}
}
\value{
The output of \code{pAddBin} gives  cumulative probability  values in vector form.
}
\description{
These functions provide the ability for generating probability function values and
cumulative probability function values for the Additive Binomial Distribution.
}
\details{
The probability function and cumulative function can be constructed and are denoted below

The cumulative probability function is the summation of probability function values.

\deqn{P_{AddBin}(x)= {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}(\frac{alpha}{2}(\frac{x(x-1)}{p}+\frac{(n-x)(n-x-1)}{(1-p)}-\frac{alpha n(n-1)}{2})+1)}

\deqn{x = 0,1,2,3,...n}
\deqn{n = 1,2,3,...}
\deqn{0 < p < 1}
\deqn{-1 < alpha < 1}

The alpha is in between
\deqn{\frac{-2}{n(n-1)}min(\frac{p}{1-p},\frac{1-p}{p}) \le alpha \le (\frac{n+(2p-1)^2}{4p(1-p)})^{-1}}

The mean and the variance are denoted as
\deqn{E_{Addbin}[x]=np}
\deqn{Var_{Addbin}[x]=np(1-p)(1+(n-1)alpha)}

\strong{NOTE} : If input parameters are not in given domain conditions
necessary error messages will be provided to go further.
